This project aims to  model interactions explicitly  in  an  Agent-Based  Model  (ABM)  incorporating  empirical  data  on  multiple  levels  (e.g., households,  schools,  institutions)  to  study  the  consequences  of  interdependent,  yet  uncoordinated individual choices for the emergence of school segregation.
